                Margherita pizza is a special variety of pizza that originates in Naples,<br>
                 Italy. In Italy, this pizza is a protected food, meaning that it must be<br>
                prepared in a certain way to bear the “pizza Margherita” label, and the<br>
                Italian government actually certifies bakeries that produce it. This<br>
                pizza is very simple, placing an emphasis on fresh, wholesome<br>
                ingredients and high quality bread dough. It is also the basis for many<br> 
                pizzas served around the world; most people can probably obtain a version<br>
                of it from a local pizza establishment, and cooks can also make it at home.<br>

                <ol>

                    <li>Prepare pizza dough through step 5, including preheating the oven to 475°F(246°C).<br>
                        Cover the shaped dough lightly with plastic wrap and allow it to rest as the oven preheats.</li>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        Mix the olive oil and chopped garlic together in a small dish. Brush the top of the dough<br>
                         lightly with olive oil. Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to<br>
                         prevent bubbling. Top with pizza sauce, then the mozzarella cheese slices, then the tomato slices.<br>
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        Bake for 14-16 minutes or until the crust is lightly browned and the cheese is bubbling.<br>
                        For the last minute, I move the oven rack to the top rack to really brown the edges.<br>
                        That's optional.
                    </li>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        Remove from the oven and top with fresh basil and pepper. Slice pizza and serve immediately.
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer.<br>
                         Baked pizza slices can be frozen up to 3 months. See pizza crust recipe for <br>
                         instructions on freezing the pizza dough.<br>
